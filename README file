Step 1: Load the Data 
● Import necessary libraries. 
● Load the CSV file into Pandas DataFrames. 
● Display the first and last few rows of each dataset. 
● Check the number of rows and columns. 
Step 2: Inspect the Data 
● View all column names. 
● Check data types of each column. 
● Display a summary of numerical columns. 
● Identify unique values in categorical columns. 
● Check for inconsistencies or unexpected values. 
Step 3: Check for Missing Values 
● Identify columns with missing or null values. 
● Decide how to handle missing data (drop, fill, or replace). 
● Verify that no missing values remain after cleaning. 
Step 4: Handle Duplicates 
● Check for duplicate rows. 
● Remove any duplicates found. 
● Confirm that the dataset no longer has duplicates. 
Step 5: Data Type Conversion 
● Identify columns that need data type correction (e.g., convert strings to numbers or 
dates). 
● Apply the appropriate data type conversions. 
● Verify that conversions are successful. 
Step 6: Rename Columns (if necessary) 
● Rename columns for clarity or consistency. 
● Ensure all column names are meaningful and standardized. 
Step 7: Save the Cleaned Dataset 
● Export the cleaned and processed dataset as a new CSV file. 
● Verify that the file saves correctly and can be reloaded without issues.
